# Hi, I'm Chai! 

I'm a Thai undergraduate student studying Computer Engineering at UCLA.
<br><br>
With over ten years of experience in programming, I have developed my own x86 compiler, convolutional neural network chess engine, online educational video platform and more. I strive to make a positive difference in the world and empower others to do the same. You can find my work as well as some of their open-sourced code repositories below.<br>
